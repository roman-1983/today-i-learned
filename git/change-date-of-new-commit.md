# Change date of a new commit

This is a thing i learned today because i totally forgot yesterday to commit my daily learned lesson.
Because i want to keep my rhythm of comitting every a new lesson, decided to learn today how to change the date of a new commit.

## Commit is the newest commit in repository

If the commit is the newest commit in repository, it is easy to use
 
    git commit --date 2017-02-18T13:37:01
    
The date has to be in the format `YYYY-MMM-DDTHH:II:SS`.
If the date is set correct - i can commit without problems.
