# Search in a file

Sometimes i have to work directly via console on some files - for example to check log-files. Off course i **never** changes files on a livesystem directly via console. ;-)

To search in vi, i use the `/` command followed by the `needle`:
```
/needle
```

With `n` and `SHIFT+n` i can easy navigate through the hits.
